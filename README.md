# OpenSky-Server
Server backend for OpenSky - a ROBLOX live text chat translator.

# How to use?
You can just pate the link to the public git repo on render.com, or self-host on a VPS if you're super cool. PLEASE note that you should change "use_json" to True for bigger games. This limits requests as much as possible and prevents the likelihood of being IP-banned from libretranslate. More about that in the below section.

# Render.com guide
First, ensure that you set it to a python project.

As shown above, set your build command to this.

Then, use this as the start command

# Disclaimer
Please buy a license from https://libretranslate.com/ if you're running this in production. Or, you could go about self-hosting LibreTranslate. Irresponsible usage may result in all roblox IP's being blacklisted from LibreTranslate if you don't have a license and you're spamming requests out of them

# ⚠️ THIS IS NOT ROBLOX CODE
This is code you are to host yourself on a service like render.com, so you can self-host your translation backend. 

# Why?
Inspired by minecraft servers (to be quite honest), I realized it'd be a perfect fit in roblox. I've been in this community for over my life, and I want to try to do something to help all developers, and all players to be able to communicate to a basic degree.

# Contributing
I really welcome anybody to make this project even better (and possibly even more secure).
However, if you find a vulnerability, please message me first so we can make a change swiftly to shorten the attack window for the vulnerability.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
